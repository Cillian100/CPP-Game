Inspired by random platformering games I played on flash websites as a kid I wanted to make a 2D puzzle game which is simple, fun and slightly challenging.

Play as a robot with the ability to warp time and change the direction of gravity as he tries to escape a collapsing factory.

This project was mostly just a way to learn a bit about game development, object orientated programmming and to try out C++.
